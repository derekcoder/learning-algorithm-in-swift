## 1. Stack vs Queue

Explain the difference of a stack and a queue. Provide two real-life examples for each data structure.

### Queue

Queues have a behavior of first-in-fist-out. What comes in first must come out first. Items in the queue are inserted from the rear, and removed from the front.

Queue Examples:
1. **Line in a movie theatre**: You would hate for people to cut the line at the movie theatre when buying tickets.
2. **Printer**: Multiple people could print documents from a printer, in a similar first-come-first-serve manner.

### Stack
 
Stack have a behavior of last-in-first-out. Items in the stack are inserted at the top, and removed from the top.

Stack Examples:
1. **Stack of plates**: Placing plates on top of each other, and removing the top plate every time you use a plate. Isnâ€™t this easier than grabbing the one at the bottom?

2. **Undo functionality**: Image typing words on a keyboard.Clicking Ctrl-Z will undo the most recent text you typed.
